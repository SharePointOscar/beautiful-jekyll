# Book - DevOps for SharePoint
My new book [DevOps for SharePoint](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-SharePoint-Terraform-Ansible-Vagrant/dp/1484236874/) was published October 2018.  The premise of my book, is to teach the IT Pros new skills and leverage the open source tool-chains out there to deploy and manage SharePoint Farms.  I walk users through deployment of farms in both AWS and Azure.  We then go through how to configure the farm all via Ansible.

# Latest Project - AWS CyberSecurity
I recently worked on an AWS greenfield project, I helped a large healthcare company layout the foundation in the security and unified logging to prep for deploying their first app to AWS.
